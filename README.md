# React Shopping Cart App
  This is a simple e-commerce web application built with ReactJS, React Router, and Tailwind CSS. The app fetches product data from the Fake Store API and allows users to add, remove, and modify products in their cart. The total price is dynamically updated, and a 10% discount is applied to the final cart total.

# Features
  Home Page: Displays a list of products fetched from the Fake Store API.
  View Cart Page: Displays items added to the cart, showing product details such as name, price, quantity, and total price.

  Add/Remove Items: Users can add products to the cart and remove them as needed. If a product is in the cart, the "Add to Cart" button changes to "Remove from Cart".

  Cart Quantity Control: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of items in the cart, and the price is dynamically updated accordingly.

  Total Price Calculation: The cart page dynamically updates the total price as items are added, removed, or their quantities are changed. A 10% discount is applied to the final price.
